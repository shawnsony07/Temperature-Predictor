# Temperature Prediction Using Linear Regression ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Overview

This project implements a linear regression model to predict monthly temperatures based on historical weather station data. The model can forecast temperatures for any given year and month using gradient descent optimization.
## Features


â€¢	Data preprocessing and cleaning

â€¢	Linear regression implementation with gradient descent.

â€¢	Temperature prediction for specific year and month.

â€¢	Visualization of temperature trends over time.

â€¢	Handling of missing values (999.9) by replacing with mean temperature.

â€¢	Logarithmic transformation for better linear fit.





## Prerequisites

â€¢	Python 3.x 

â€¢	Required Python packages (see requirements.txt) 

â€¢	Input data file: station.csv with columns: 

    â€¢	YEAR
    
    â€¢	Monthly temperature columns (JAN through DEC)

## Installation

1.	Clone the repository
2.	Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## Usage

1.	Ensure your station.csv file is in the same directory as the script

2.	Run the script:

```bash
python temperature_prediction.py
```

3.	When prompted:

    â€¢	Enter the year for prediction

    â€¢	Enter the month number (1-12)

4.	The script will display:

    â€¢	A plot showing the temperature trends

    â€¢	The predicted temperature for the specified year and month



## Model Details

â€¢	Uses simple linear regression 

â€¢	Applies logarithmic transformation to both features and target variables 

â€¢	Implements gradient descent optimization 

â€¢	Learning rate (alpha) = 0.01 

â€¢	Number of iterations = 2000





## Output

â€¢	Visualization of temperature trends

â€¢	Predicted temperature for specified year and month in Â°C




## Error Handling

â€¢	Missing values (999.9) are replaced with the mean temperature.

â€¢	Data is transformed using log10 for better linear fit.
